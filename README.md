# EcommerceApp
This project is an emulation of an ecommerce app which allows users to add and remove products in cart and checkout after authentication. It also gives users an option to chat and ask questions regarding available inventory.
We use an sqlite database to hold inventory information. This project has been done using Django, pyhon, langchain, chatgpt and sqlite.
